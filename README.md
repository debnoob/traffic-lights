# traffic-lights

To start training, first unzip [data.zip](/data.zip) into the root directory of `traffic-lights` so that the directory tree looks like: `/traffic-lights/data/GREEN/green_img.png`.

When you run train.py, it will then start a process of cropping images from the data set into the `/traffic-lights/data/flowed` directory.

*Due to the dataset size being greater than GitHub's LFS max file size of 2GB, you can download data.zip from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zyt28sGXxvXaeSdj-kab2W_kWCH5fPIX), or MEGA (link coming soon).*
