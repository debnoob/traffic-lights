# traffic-lights

To start training, first unzip [data.zip](/data.zip) into the root directory of `traffic-lights` so that the directory tree looks like: `/traffic-lights/data/GREEN/green_img.png`.

When you run train.py, it will then start a process of creating randomly transformed images from the data set into the [/data/flowed](/traffic-lights/data/flowed) directory. 10 images per original image is generated by default.
